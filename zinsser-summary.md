Summary by Vamsi Koduru
============
Zinsser talks about simplicity and clutter in chapters 2 and 3 respectively. To be a good writer only the essential words should be used in a sentence. Long sentences are more likely to lose the attention of the reader than simple ones. Zinsser also mentions how cluttered sentences are a result of a writer with cluttered thoughts. Clutter can be a result of people trying to seem more important. Most professions have their own jargons to add clutter to their statements. The more you look over your sentences, the more clutter that can be found and removed.
